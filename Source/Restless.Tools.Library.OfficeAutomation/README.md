# Restless Animal Tools Library (MS Office Auxiliary Library)
Provides MS Office interaction features, such as .doc to .docx conversion.

This (simple) project provides a supplemental .dll that may be added to projects that require the ability to convert .doc to .docx.
This project requires a reference to Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.

One of the goals of this project was to separate the need for the interop into another (optional) .dll
